# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** December 18, 2024  
**Last Updated:** December 18, 2024

## Introduction

Afterpage is designed with your privacy in mind. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our document scanning and organization app.

**The short version:** We don't collect, store, or have access to your documents or personal information. Everything stays on your device and in your iCloud Drive.

## Information We Don't Collect

We believe the best way to protect your privacy is to not collect your data in the first place. Afterpage does not:

- Collect or store your documents on our servers
- Access your documents remotely
- Track your usage patterns or behavior
- Sell your data to third parties
- Use your documents for advertising
- Require you to create an account with us
- Send your documents to any third-party services

## How Afterpage Works

### On-Device Processing

All document processing happens entirely on your device:

- **OCR (text recognition)** uses Apple's Vision framework running on your iPhone or iPad
- **Document classification** uses on-device machine learning models
- **Search and organization** operates on local or iCloud data you control

We never send your documents to external servers for processing.

### Where Your Documents Are Stored

You choose where your documents live:

- **iCloud Drive**: Documents are stored in your personal iCloud Drive, secured by Apple's encryption and protected by your Apple ID credentials
- **Local Storage**: Alternatively, documents can be stored only on your device

Either way, your documents remain under your control in storage infrastructure you already own and trust.

### Metadata and Organization Data

When you organize documents with tags, document types, and correspondents, this metadata is stored:

- **With iCloud sync**: Metadata is stored in your iCloud account using CloudKit, encrypted and protected by Apple
- **Without iCloud sync**: Metadata stays only on your device

We use Apple's standard iCloud infrastructure. We do not have access to your iCloud data.

## Information We Do Collect

### App Analytics

To help us improve Afterpage and fix issues, we collect anonymous, aggregated analytics data about:

- App crashes and performance issues
- General feature usage (not document content)
- Device type and iOS version

**This data does not contain any personally identifiable information (PII).** We cannot link this data to you, your Apple ID, or your documents. The analytics help us understand how the app performs and where we should focus improvements.

### Purchase Information

When you subscribe to Afterpage Plus:

- Your subscription is managed entirely by Apple through the App Store
- We receive only confirmation that a subscription is active (no payment details, no personal information)
- All payment processing is handled by Apple according to their privacy policy

## Permissions We Request

To function properly, Afterpage requests the following permissions:

### Camera Access

Required to scan documents with your device camera. Camera data is processed on-device and never transmitted elsewhere.

### Photos Access

Required to import images from your photo library. We only access photos you explicitly select for import.

### Files Access

Required to import PDF files and export documents. We only access files you choose to import or locations you select for export.

### iCloud Drive Access (Optional)

Required only if you choose to store documents in iCloud Drive. This enables sync across your Apple devices using your iCloud account.

You can review and modify these permissions anytime in iOS Settings > Afterpage.

## Data Security

### On-Device Security

Your documents are protected by:

- Your device's passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID
- iOS file system encryption
- Standard iOS sandboxing that isolates app data

### iCloud Security

If you use iCloud storage, your documents benefit from:

- End-to-end encryption for data in transit
- Apple's iCloud security infrastructure
- Protection by your Apple ID credentials and two-factor authentication

For more details on iCloud security, see [Apple's iCloud Security Overview](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202303).

## Children's Privacy

Afterpage is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided information to us, please contact us and we will delete it.

## Third-Party Services

Afterpage uses only Apple's built-in frameworks and services:

- **Apple Vision** for OCR
- **Core ML** for document classification  
- **CloudKit** for iCloud sync (if enabled)
- **StoreKit** for in-app purchases

We do not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## International Users and Data Location

If you use iCloud Drive, your data is stored in Apple's data centers according to [Apple's data location policies](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data-management/). Apple complies with applicable data protection laws including GDPR for European users.

Documents stored locally remain only on your device, in your physical possession.

## Your Rights

You have complete control over your data:

### Access

All your documents and metadata are accessible directly in the app at any time.

### Deletion

You can delete individual documents, clear all data, or uninstall the app to remove everything.

### Export

You can export any document as a PDF and transfer your data out of Afterpage whenever you wish.

### iCloud Control

You can enable or disable iCloud sync in iOS Settings. Disabling iCloud sync stops syncing but does not delete existing data.

### Data Portability

Export your documents as searchable PDFs compatible with other document management systems.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. When we make changes:

- We will update the "Last Updated" date at the top
- For material changes, we will notify you through the app or via the email associated with your App Store account
- Continued use of Afterpage after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy
